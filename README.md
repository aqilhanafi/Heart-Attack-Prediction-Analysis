# Heart Attack Prediction Analysis
Heart attack prediction analysis combines Excel and Python to analyze data and build a predictive model. The process involves collecting a dataset with relevant information about individuals. Excel is used for initial data exploration and preprocessing, including cleaning, handling missing values, and visualization. The prepared data is then exported to Python, where advanced analysis and modeling take place. Python's extensive libraries, like NumPy and scikit-learn, enable statistical analysis, feature engineering, and model training. The ultimate goal is to develop a reliable predictive model that can identify individuals at risk of experiencing a heart attack based on their demographic, lifestyle, and medical factors.
